Description: The 'fastverse' package integrates, and provides utilities for easy installation, 
             loading and management, of a complementary set of high-performance packages for 
             statistical computing and data manipulation. The core 'fastverse' consists of 6 packages:
             'data.table', 'collapse', 'matrixStats', 'kit', 'magrittr' and 'fst', that jointly only
             depend on 'Rcpp'. These packages are attached and harmonized through the 'fastverse'. 
             In addition, the 'fastverse' can be freely and permanently extended with additional packages, 
             both globally or for individual projects. Extension packages also are attached and managed 
             by the 'fastverse'. Selected fast packages for various topics such as time series, dates 
             and times, strings, spatial data and statistics are suggested in the 'README' file.
