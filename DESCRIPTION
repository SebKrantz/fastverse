Description: The 'fastverse' package integrates and provides utilities for easy installation, 
             loading and management of a complimentary set of high-performance R packages for 
             statistical computing and data manipulation. The core fastverse consists of 6 packages:
             'data.table', 'collapse', 'matrixStats', 'kit', 'magrittr' and 'fst'. These are loaded
             and harmonized whenever the 'fastverse' is loaded (the 'fastverse' modifies a number of
             matrixStats functions to make them handle attributes consistently). Additional fast packages 
             for time series, dates and times, string manipulation, spatial manipulation and statistics 
             are suggested and can be bulk-loaded through the fastverse_extend() function. 
             All 'fastverse' packages are carefully designed, deliver outstanding C/C++ powered 
             performance, handle various R objects and real-world data well, and share a minimal 
             dependency burden (the core fastverse depends on the 6 packages + 'Rcpp').
