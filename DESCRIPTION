Description: Easy installation, loading and management, of a complementary set of 
             high-performance packages for statistical computing and data manipulation. 
             The core 'fastverse' consists of 6 packages: 'data.table', 'collapse', 
             'matrixStats', 'kit', 'magrittr' and 'fst', that jointly only depend on 
             'Rcpp'. These packages are attached and harmonized through the 'fastverse'. 
             In addition, the 'fastverse' can be freely and permanently extended with 
             additional packages, both globally or for individual projects. Selected 
             fast and low-dependency packages are suggested for various topics such as 
             time series, dates and times, strings, spatial data and statistics  
             (see 'README.md' on GitHub / website).
