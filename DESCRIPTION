Description: The 'fastverse' package integrates and provides utilities for easy installation, 
             loading and management of a complimentary set of high-performance R packages for 
             statistical computing and data manipulation. The core fastverse consists of 6 packages:
             'data.table', 'collapse', 'matrixStats', 'kit', 'magrittr' and 'fst'. These are loaded
             and harmonized whenever the 'fastverse' is loaded (the 'fastverse' modifies a number of
             matrixStats functions to make them handle attributes consistently). The fastverse can freely 
             and permanently be extended with additional packages. Selected fast packages for time series, 
             dates and times, string manipulation, spatial manipulation and statistics are suggested as 
             extensions. All core 'fastverse' packages and suggested extensions are carefully 
             designed, deliver outstanding C/C++ powered performance, handle various R objects and real-world 
             data well, and share a minimal dependency burden (the core fastverse only depends on the 6 packages + 'Rcpp').
