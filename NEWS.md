# fastverse 0.1.6
CRAN rejected 0.1.5, which made sure *matrixStats* handles attributes consistently whenever the *fastverse* is attached, because CRAN packages are not allowed to modify the namespace of other packages. Thus 0.1.6 comes in two versions: A CRAN version which takes *matrixStats* as it is, and a GitHub version which is the original 0.1.5. User who value a consistent *matrixStats* that preserves dimension names in all functions are recommended the GitHub version. 

# fastverse 0.1.5
First *fastverse* CRAN submission on 7th August 2021. Development started in Spring 2021.
