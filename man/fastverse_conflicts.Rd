\title{Conflicts between the fastverse and other packages}
\usage{
fastverse_conflicts(pck = fastverse_packages(FALSE))
}
\description{
This function lists all the conflicts between packages in the fastverse
and other packages that you have loaded.
}
\details{
There is an internal conflict between \code{collapse::funique} and \code{kit::funique}. 
If both packages are unloaded, \code{collapse} is loaded before \code{kit}. In general the 
\code{collapse} version is often faster on data frames whereas the \code{kit} version is generally
faster for vectors and also supports matrices.
